# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
tHis project is submmited from Erlind Shahini for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. All the instructions are included inside the script file.

# Dataset used for this project

# Files uploaded in the github
- [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/erlind1987/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/CodeBook.md) is the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

- run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
  -- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  -- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  -- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- SecondTidySet.txt is the exported second tidy set of data after going through all the steps described above.
